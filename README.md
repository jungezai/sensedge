This repo is for ElderSens Inc's SensEdge Project：Fallsens Location Display System.

###Preparation in advance
<<<<<<< HEAD
SensEdge1.Connecting the LAN WiFi for 4 Router Router is connected to the mouse and display, and the WiFi is manually connected, and it is set to an automatic 
connection. (default will be automatically connected next time) 2.Set the Host name of 4 Router 4 raspberry pie Router as the positioning base, the position origin 
4 of the Router host ======== name is set to "raspberrypi",and it will be the master Router to calculate fallsens's position; a clockwise direction of the next 
Router name is "raspClient1", "raspClient2", the last "raspClient3".

3.Install samba Execute the command line command: sudo apt-get install samba. The purpose is to use the "nmblookup" command 
in the LAN to use the host name to query the corresponding IP address. Execute the command line command: sudo apt-get install
 samba waiting for the completion of installation.

###Install the main software 
1.Install software The folder "sensedge" is placed in the path: /home/pi/src/git/eldersens/sensedge; into the "sensedge" 
folder, execute command line: ./run.sh install waiting for the completion of installation.
2.Restart the Router execute command line: sudo reboot waiting for the completion of restart.

###The process of using the positioning system
1.Open sensedge service The default will automatically turn on the sensedge service after boot. It can be commanded by command
 line: "sudo sensedge start", "sudo sensedge stop", "sudo sensedge restart" ,to opening、closing and restarting service.

view the location on the web page 
(1)In running MasterRouter, through the command line command: "node webserver.js", run the 
"webserver.js" file under the "sensedge" folder to open the nodejs server.
(2)In one of the 4 Router,Open the "ajax.html" file under the "sensedge" folder through the browser, that is, you can see the 
change in the location on the web page.

###Other instructions
In this sensedge service, the 4 Router will search attribute values around fallsens, through the command line
: "tail- f var/log/sensedge.log" to view information and the corresponding error; Master Router will open the MQTT server, 
and push on the receiving server TAG information, and the device MQTT attribute information stored in the "sensedge" folder 
under the "trying.log" file. The other 3 Router will push the distance data to the MQTT server, and also through command 
line command: "tail- f var/log/sensedge.log" to check the corresponding information and errors.

In Master Router, When the MQTT server receives the TAG message, it will save the data to the "MQTTdistanceData.log" file under the 
"sensedge" folder.

In Master Router Sensedge service monitors the change of trying.log in real time. When new 4 distance data exist, sensedge 
service calls executable file "CalculatePosition", which saves the calculated device location information to position.log under the sensedge folder.

After the nodejs server is opened, the server monitors the changes of the "position.log" file under the sensedge folder 
in real time, and waits for the request of the webpage. When receiving the request of the webpage, it will return the device 
information of the requested device.
